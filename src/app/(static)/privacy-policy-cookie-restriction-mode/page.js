        Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes
        also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Airport Home Appliance to
        count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded
        services. Airport Home Appliance may include Web beacons in promotional
        e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been
        opened and acted upon. Some of these Web beacons may be placed by
        third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our
        advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be
        used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your
        computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer
        each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous
        information about those page views, which in turn enables us and our
        service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to
        our website and how you use the site. Airport Home Appliance prohibits
        Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal
        information.
