                    To exercise the rights described above, California residents may submit
                    a verifiable consumer request which must provide sufficient information
                    that allows us to verify, to a reasonably high degree of certainty, that
                    you are the person about whom we collected personal information and must
                    describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
                    understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

                  <p className="mb-4 md:text-sm">
                    Only you, or a person you have designated in writing as your authorized
                    agent under applicable law, may make a verifiable consumer request or do
                    not sell request related to your personal information. You may only make
                    a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request on behalf of your
                    minor child. If you wish to have an Authorized Agent make a request on
                    your behalf, they will need to provide us with sufficient written proof
                    that you have designated them as your Authorized Agent and we will still
                    require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably
                    verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal
                    information.

                    request and confirm the personal informatio n relates to you. Making a
                    verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
                    with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable

                    make the request.

                    the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days
                    when reasonably necessary and with prior notice. You may only make a
                    verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within
                    a 12-month period. Please be aware that not all information sharing is
